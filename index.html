                <h2>BIOGRAPHY</h2>
                <p>Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj also spelled as Sivaji was born on 19 February 1630. 
                    He was born at Shivneri which is a hill fort in Junnar in Poona, now known as Pune. 
                    Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj took birth into a family of bureaucrats. 
                    His father Shahji Bhonsale was a great Maratha general in the army of Bijapur Sultanate and his mother Jijabai was a great devotee of religion. 
                    He was the founder of the great Maratha kingdom of India. He was one of the bravest and marvelous rulers in the 17th century.
                    Chatrapati Shivaji Shahaji Bhosale was an Indian ruler and a member of the Bhonsle Dynasty.
                    Shivaji carved out his own independent kingdom from the declining Adilshahi Sultanate of Bijapur that formed the genesis of the Maratha Empire. 
                    In 1674, he was formally crowned the Chhatrapati of his realm at Raigad Fort.
                    Over the course of his life, Shivaji engaged in both alliances and hostilities with the Mughal Empire, the Sultanate of Golkonda, the Sultanate of Bijapur and the European colonial powers. 
                    Following the Battle of Purandar, Shivaji entered into a vassalage with the Mughal empire, assuming the role of a Mughal chief and undertaking military expeditions on behalf of the empire for a brief duration.
                    Shivaji's military forces expanded the Maratha sphere of influence, capturing and building forts, and forming a Maratha navy. 
                    Shivaji established a competent and progressive civil administration with well-structured administrative institutions. 
                    He revived ancient Hindu political traditions, court conventions and promoted the use of the Marathi and Sanskrit languages, replacing Persian at court and in administration.
                    Praised for his chivalrous treatment of women,Shivaji employed people of all castes and religions, including Muslims and Europeans, in his administration and armed forces.
                    Shivaji's legacy was to vary by observer and time, but nearly two centuries after his death he began to take on increased importance with the emergence of the Indian independence movement, 
                    as many Indian nationalists elevated him as a proto-nationalist and hero of the Hindus.
                    In conclusion, Shivaji's life was full of hostilities with the kingdoms surrounding the Maratha region and also allianced to fight the wars. 
                    Finally, he established the Kingdom of Maratha and is still remembered as a great king of India.

                            Having rechristened it to Prachandgad, Shivaji Maharaj constructed monuments on its massive spread.</p>

                            His brother took charge and won over the fort. Grieving this loss, Shivaji Maharaj remorsefully said, “Gad aala, pan Sinha gela” – We won the fort, but lost the lion. 
                            This explains the name and its importance in the pages of Maratha history.</p>
